My first question before I started learning React was ***what do I need to know as a prerequisite?***.

- React is a JavaScript library. Do I need to know JavaScript or TypeScript?
- React is a technology that renders web pages. Do I need to know HTML and CSS?
- The development environment of React relies on Babel, Webpack, Node, and npm. Do I need to understand all of them?

So, let me tackle this point. You do not need to understand any of these before you start your React journey.

Yes, this mix of technologies might confuse you, and sometimes it's hard to know the source of the confusion, but you can learn them on the go.

A big tip I got from my teacher is to narrow down the confusion to the relevant topic. Ask yourself what you don't understand in the code. Is it JavaScript? TypeScript? HTML? CSS?

// create a infographics of all the technologies and try to assign them to the correct topic.

### Server Side Rendering vs. Single Page Application
