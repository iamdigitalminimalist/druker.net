This blog post is an intertextual-tribute to the prologue of the book _"[Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind](https://www.shambhala.com/zen-mind-beginner-s-mind-1796.html),"_ written by the Japanese Zen monk [Shunryu Suzuki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunry%C5%AB_Suzuki).

<hr />

> "In the beginner's mind there are many possibilities; in the expert's mind, there are few." &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‚Äî **Shunryu Suzuki**

People think that coding is challenging, but there is a misunderstanding as to why.
It is not challenging because it is hard to learn how to develop a web app or to become a DevOps master.
It is challenging because it is hard to keep your curiosity and motivation in their purest sense<br />

I was first introduced to coding when I was 10 years old.
I attended a one-week summer camp at a small community center, where we learned HTML and JavaScript from high school students.
I got super excited, and immediately I became obsessed with it, as if I could learn it all.
6 years later, still enchanted and motivated, I studied Computer Science and Math in high school and loved the logic behind programming.<br />

Although I improved over the years and worked with the most advanced technology, as young as 18, I have gradually lost the limitless meaning I had with the original mind.
When I took Computer Science at university, I got overwhelmed by the requirements and life in general, and I ended up abandoning technology as a passion for a few years.

About 2 years ago, a dear-loving friend suggested looking into React and JavaScript.
Inspired by my friend, I decided to reconnect with my love for coding and approach it as a beginner.
**_Lior, 10x for the encouragement! It gives a new mean to express creativity_** üôèüèº<br />

> "The beginner's mind is the mind of compassion. When our mind is compassionate, it is boundless." &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‚Äî **Shunryu Suzuki**

But enough stories for now because I don't want to talk about my tech background, university, trauma, or the history of DevOps.
**_I'm interested in helping you to keep your coding journey from becoming impure._** <br />

In Japanese, there is the phrase **_ÂàùÂøÉ_** (pronounced: **_Shoshin_**), which means **_beginner's mind_**.
In the beginner's mind, there are no preconceived ideas or notions about what we know, which keeps our minds wide open and ready for anything.
_<u>Tip</u>: if you feel lost or discouraged, get in touch with your beginner's mind_.

### What do you need to get started?

- **Patience**. Similarly to studying a foreign language, you can't learn coding all at once and make rapid progress. Learn it little by little.
- **Endurance**. Endurance. Sometimes in the journey, you may feel lost. Let it come and let it go, but don't serve it a cup of tea.
- **Teacher**. Find a coding mentor and follow them. See if you can get chat with a teacher and about what you learn and discover. _<u>Hint</u>: in the beginner's mind, everyone could be your teacher._

So the biggest challenge is to keep your beginner's mind. The rest will keep itself, moment after moment.
There is no need to have a deep understanding of technology or a CS degree.
Even though you read many docs and articles, you should read each sentence with a fresh mind.
You would rather not say, "I know what coding is," or "I have mastered DevOps."
_Be careful about this point._

In the next post, I will share the core of the front-end developer.

```JSX
import { ThemeProvider } from 'zen-mind'
import { Component } from 'developer-mind'
import { theme } from '../styles/beginners-mind'
import { Button } from '../components/Button'
import { BeginnersMindAppProps } from '../libs/@types'

export const BeginnersMindApp = (props: BeginnersMindAppProps) => {
  const [isDiscourage, setIsDiscourage] = useState(false)

  handleOnDiscouarge = async () => {
    try {
      await Promise.all([
        props.patience.slowDown(),
        props.endurance.letItGo(),
        props.teacher.findCodingTeacher()
      ])
      setIsDiscourage(false)
    } catch (error) {
      console.log(error)
    }
  }

  return (
  <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
    {isDiscourage
