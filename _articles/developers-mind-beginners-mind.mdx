This blog post is an intertextual tribute to the prologue of the book *"[Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind](https://www.shambhala.com/zen-mind-beginner-s-mind-1796.html),"* written by the Japanese Zen monk [Shunryu Suzuki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunry%C5%AB_Suzuki).

>"In the beginner's mind there are many possibilities; in the expert's mind, there are few." &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‚Äî **Shunryu Suzuki**

People think that coding is challenging, but there is a misunderstanding as to why.
It is not challenging because it is hard to learn how to develop a web app or to become a DevOps master.
It is challenging because it is hard to keep your curiosity and motivation in their purest form, as you had when you had just started.<br />

I was first introduced to coding when I was about 10 years old.
I attended a one-week summer camp at a community center, where we learned HTML and JavaScript from high school students.
I got super excited, and immediately I became obsessed with it.
6 years later, still enchanted and motivated, I studied Computer Science and Math in high school to deepen my understanding of the logic behind programming.<br />

Unfortunately, after a few years of military service, I took Computer Science at university, and I got overwhelmed by the requirements and life in general.
I ended up abandoning technology as a passion for a few years.<br />

About 2 years ago, a dear-loving friend suggested looking into React and JavaScript.
Inspired by my friend, I decided to reconnect with my love for coding and approach it as a beginner.
Lior, 10x for the encouragement üôèüèº<br />

But I do not want to talk about my tech background, university, trauma, or the history of DevOps.
***I'm interested in helping you to keep your coding journey from becoming impure.*** <br />

In Japanese, there is the phrase *ÂàùÂøÉ* (pronounced: *Shoshin*), which means ***beginner's mind***.
In the beginner's mind, there are no preconceived ideas or notions about what we know, which keeps our minds open and ready for anything.
*<u>Suggestion</u>: do not forget about this point and get in touch with your beginner's mind if you feel lost or discouraged*.

### What do you need to get started?
- **Patience**. Similarly to studying a foreign language, you can't learn coding all at once and make remarkable progress. Learn it little by little.
- **Endurance**. Sometimes in the process, you may feel lost and incapable. That's OK. Do not stop. Cheer up and move on.
- **Teacher**. Find a coding mentor and follow them. See if you can get chat with a teacher and about what you learn and discover. *<u>Remember</u>: in the beginner's mind, everyone could be your teacher.*

>"The beginner's mind is the mind of compassion. When our mind is compassionate, it is boundless." &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‚Äî **Shunryu Suzuki**

So the biggest challenge is to keep your beginner's mind. The rest will happen by itself, moment after moment.
There is no need to have a deep understanding of technology or a CS degree.
Even though you read many docs and articles, you should read each sentence with a fresh mind.
You would rather not say, "I know what coding is," or "I'm a DevOps master."
*Be careful about this point.*

In the next post, I will elaborate on the bare essentials of the front-end developer.
