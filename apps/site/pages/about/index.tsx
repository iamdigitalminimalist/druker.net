                <h4 className="sm:-my-0.5">Kindness ‚ù£Ô∏è</h4>
                <p>
                  I feel very fortunate for the many kind people I crossed paths
                  with who taught me the importance of kindness as a way of
                  living. Throughout my journey, I have learned that it feels
                  better to give than to take, and that if you are mindful and
                  kind to your surroundings, people remember your generosity and
                  pass that attitude onward.
                </p>
                <h4 className="sm:-my-0.5">Simplicity üßòüèΩ</h4>
                <p>
                  Life is full of distractions, and one could get overwhelmed
                  when things are complicated and confusing. I found the
                  practice of simplicity to be a key to overcoming these
                  moments. Every time I get to this confused state of mind, I
                  take a deep breath and ask myself: &ldquo;what is
                  essential?&rdquo; and then prioritize.
                </p>
                <h4 className="sm:-my-0.5">Collaboration üë¨</h4>
                <p>
                  I am fascinated by the open-source culture established by the
                  dev community. It is intriguing how different technologies,
                  such as version control systems like{' '}
