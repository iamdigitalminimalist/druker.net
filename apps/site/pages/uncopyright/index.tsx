              Why I&#8217;m releasing copyright
            </h2>
            <p>
              I&#8217;m not a big fan of copyright laws, especially as
              they&#8217;re being applied by corporations, used to crack down on
              the little guys so they can continue their large profits.
            </p>
            <p>
              Copyrights are often said to protect the artist, but in most cases
              the artist gets very little while the corporations make most of
              the money.
            </p>
            <p>
              I think, in most cases, the protectionism that is touted by
              &#8220;anti-piracy&#8221; campaigns and lawsuits and lobbying
              actually hurts the artist. Limiting distribution to protect
              profits isn&#8217;t a good thing.
            </p>
            <p>
              The lack of copyright, and blatant copying by other artists and
              even businesses, never hurt Leonardo da Vinci when it comes to
              images such as the Mona Lisa. It&#8217;s never hurt Shakespeare. I
              doubt that it&#8217;s ever really hurt any artist (although I
              might just be ignorant here).
            </p>
            <p>
              And while I&#8217;m certainly not da Vinci or Shakespeare, if
              someone feels like sharing my content on their blog, or in any
              other form for that matter, that&#8217;s a good thing for me.
              That&#8217;s something to celebrate, as I see it.
            </p>
            <p>
              And if someone wants to take my work and improve upon it, as
              artists have been doing for centuries, I think that&#8217;s a
              wonderful thing. If they can take my favorite posts and make
              something funny or inspiring or thought-provoking or even sad
              &#8230; I say more power to them. The creative community only
              benefits from derivations and inspirations.
            </p>
            <p>
              This isn&#8217;t a new concept, of course, and I&#8217;m freely
              ripping ideas off here. Which is kinda the point.
